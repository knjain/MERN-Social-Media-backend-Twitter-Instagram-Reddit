Hello ,

Welcome to my Github profile.
This particular repository is of recent MERN stack SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION developement.

I have programmed backend of this social media app using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, incorporating features resembling popular platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reddit.

I have implemented functionalities including posting, commenting, liking, reposting (Twitter-like), posting reels/videos (Instagram-like), individual and group chat (WhatsApp-like), and text-based conversation platform (Reddit-like).

Programmed 40+ Rest APIs to handle the different functionalities and tested them using Postman.

I you are wondering why this project has only 1 or 2 commits, it is becasue this is a clone of my original project which I cannot keep public due to security,NDA and client confidentiality. 
Thanks for understanding.
